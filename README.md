## QPM - QAC based Project Manager

An utility that makes it easy to manage software projects based on Harbour and xHarbour compilers and MiniGui, Extended Minigui, and Object Oriented (x)Harbour Gui graphics libraries. It provides tools that assists programmers in the processes of program writing, compilation, debugging and linking by offering interactive and batch tools to:

+Access external utilities to edit fonts, forms, headers and DBF files.
+Keep and recover previous versions of modified files (hot recovery function).
+View and search source files, forms, headers, and DBF files.
+Incrementally compile GUI, console, and mixed-type programs.
+View error files resulting from compilation and execution.
+View .PPO files (preprocessor output).
+Execute post-build processes.
+Create CHM and HTML help files.
+Create static libraries and DLL access interfaces.
+Show the names of the functions included in static and dynamic libraries.
+Compress EXE files with the UPX utility.
